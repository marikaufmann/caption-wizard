            innovative experience through our AI-generated captions. We
            acknowledge that while AI technology is revolutionary, it may not
            always meet your expectations. It's essential for us to ensure
            you're fully informed of this inherent risk before proceeding with
            any purchases.

            Due to the substantial costs involved in powering the advanced GPUs

            that this policy may not align with everyone's preferences, yet it
            enables us to uphold a fair and sustainable service for all our
            valued users.
